# Best Practices Checklist

## What is this?

This document is a collection of language specific resources that one can use to look up the best practices followed by that particular language's community.

## Why this repo?

I am a programming language enthusiast and I like picking up new languages all the time. Like most curious devs I learn different languages by implementing a few projects in them. While this can be achieved by writing quick hacks that mostly turn out to be shitty code. But if we want our projects to be publicly available to be used or hacked on by others we must ensure that the code we write is idiomatic. That is the purpose of this repo to serve as a collection of resources that I can quickly access to make sure that my code is idiomatic before making it public.

## What counts as an acceptable entry to this list of resources?

It could be anything from articles to books to videos that describe on how to write idiomatic code in a particular language, what build systems or package managers to use, how to good write unit/integration tests, or another repo containing links related to different styles and idioms of a language or just talking about software design in general etc.

**Note:** Some of the resources might be learning material for beginners but since they too contain idiomatic code snippets they can be considered as a vaild entry.
